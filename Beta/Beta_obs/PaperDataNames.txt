Dataset 1: Individual galaxies table 1 from:
Discovery of red galaxy candidates at z ~ 12: Early dust growth or significant nebular emission with high-temperature stars?

Dataset 2: Individual galaxies table 1 from:
The ultraviolet continuum slopes (β) of galaxies at z ~ 8–16 from JWST
and ground-based near-infrared imaging

Dataset 3: Multiple binned observations table 2 from: 
The UV continuum slopes of early star-forming galaxies in JADES

Dataset 4: Individual galaxies table 1 from:
The ultraviolet continuum slopes of high-redshift galaxies: evidence for the emergence of dust-free stellar populations at z > 10
### You do not need this dataset, I mention it here because the numbering goes weird. All galaxies in
this dataset are in dataset 2.

Dataset 5: Exerpt of the 10 example on the upper part of table 3 from:
Physical properties of galaxies and the UV Luminosity Function from z ∼ 6 to z ∼ 14 in COSMOS-We
Note that they should have many more as they mention their sample size in table 2. They also have some higher redshift which I did not add yet.
